# My First Project with React + Vite

In this exciting debut in the world of programming with React and Vite, I have created a fully functional application that connects with the NASA API. This application, designed to be completely responsive, provides fascinating information about two key elements of space: the Photo of the Day and the rover exploring Mars.

# Responsive Design:
A highlight of this project is its fully responsive design. The application is designed to seamlessly adapt to any device, whether it's a desktop computer or a mobile phone.

# Photo of the Day:
The application fetches the Photo of the Day from the NASA API, offering a unique and spectacular view of the cosmos every day. This feature allows users to explore the vastness of the universe from the comfort of their screen.

# Mars Rover:
Additionally, the application also gathers data about the rover traversing Mars. It provides details about its current location, the images it captures, and the scientific discoveries it makes on the Red Planet. It's a direct window into the exciting real-time exploration of Mars.
